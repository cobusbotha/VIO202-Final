            "A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can
            obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love
            this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched
            this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's
            just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the
            visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the
            story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than
            to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't
            change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be
            too far stretched, but you still can never predict those things. The
            deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and other places would be an
            indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really
            good, but I can understand if some people have issues with the
            ending. But the movie had to end in one way or another. It's the
            best possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just
            yet ..."

            "I think just about everything has been said about this film now.
            But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me,
            this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it
            questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's
            our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown.
            We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is
            not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this
            civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let
            anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and
            wonder, because that's what makes us human. Without this stargazing
            we are merely animals, accepting our fate in the dust...""

          Interstellar Movie Review — Christopher Nolan’s most epic, but human
          movie yet
        </h3>
        <q>
          <em><strong>Interstellar</strong></em> is a visual masterpiece that
          has a human touch that propels it to greatness. It is perhaps one of
          the best space movies ever made.
        </q>
        <p id="smashreviews">
          "Christopher Nolan isn’t one known to be taciturn when it comes to his
          movies. Even his smaller movies like Momento have grand structures
          bolstering their simple plots. However, Interstellar is easily is
          first brush with the epic — unless you consider the full Dark Knight
          trilogy as one. On paper, it should not work. A sweeping narrative
          covering different times and worlds would be eaten up by audiences.
          That’s why Gravity found so much success financially and at the
          Oscars. But Nolan does something completely different with
          Interstellar. He introduces science in a way that isn’t watered down
          or ignored. His film, according to astrophysicists, is completely
          plausible. Though that fact makes the movie a hard one to digest for
          viewers, the end result is an incredible study of human nature and our
          desire to survive."

          "To infinity and beyond goes “Interstellar,” an exhilarating slalom
          through the wormholes of Christopher Nolan’s vast imagination that is
          at once a science-geek fever dream and a formidable consideration of
          what makes us human. As visually and conceptually audacious as
          anything Nolan has yet done, the director’s ninth feature also proves
          more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and
          Batman movies, touching on such eternal themes as the sacrifices
          parents make for their children (and vice versa) and the world we will
          leave for the next generation to inherit. An enormous undertaking
          that, like all the director’s best work, manages to feel handcrafted
          and intensely personal, “Interstellar” reaffirms Nolan as the premier
          big-canvas storyteller of his generation, more than earning its place
          alongside “The Wizard of Oz,” “2001,” “Close Encounters of the Third
          Kind” and “Gravity” in the canon of Hollywood’s visionary sci-fi head
          trips. Global box office returns should prove suitably
          rocket-powered."
